Having worked through "The Little Schemer" by Friedman and Felleisen, I decided to dig deeper into Scheme by working through "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Abelson, Sussman and Sussman (second edition). It's 600+ pages and I'm doing this in my spare time, so we'll see how far I get.

I'll post my solutions to exercises in a given section in a single file. As with my solutions to The Little Schemer, I'm using Gambit-Scheme, so there may be some variations from the book/what others might implement.

Comments/questions are welcome.
